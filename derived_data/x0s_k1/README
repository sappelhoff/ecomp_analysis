The derivatives in here are based on fixing the kappa parameter "k" to be 1 in
`beh_modeling.py` (see `bounds` variable and `kappa0s`), and then running
`beh_weightings.py`. From the resulting outputs, `derived_data/weights.tsv` is being
saved as `x0s_k1/weights_k1.tsv`.

Other resulting files are:

- `posweights.tsv` (from `beh_weightings.py`)
- `x0s_Nelder-Mead.npy` (from `beh_modeling.py`)
- `estim_paarams_Nelder-Mead.tsv` (from `beh_modeling.py`)

These may either be saved and pulled to the `x0s_k1` directory, or overwritten with
the "standard" files again that result when **not** constraining "k" to be 1.
